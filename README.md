# About
  Objective: the goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Planning your app design and navigation before coding
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Building layouts to display those lists of data
* Navigating between lists in Fragments using either a ViewPager plus TabLayout or Navigation Drawer*
* Creating your own custom classes
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable)

Navigation Drawers were not covered in this course.

## Reflections

* ListView is showing its limitations performance-wise. Am considering using RecyclerView.
